# How to use in your Workspace?

For using it in your own Workspace you have multiple options.

These Collections [are using Collection Variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/), make sure to fill all the variables that you will use before launching requests!

## Option A. You can use it from the Web View Collections linked above.
The variables that you define under the `Current value` input are stored only in your account, so you can safely use it from there.

## Option B. [Fork it directly](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-version-control/forking-entities/) from the Web View collections linked above.
This should allow you to fork it directly into your Workspace.

## Option C. [Import it directly](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/importing-and-exporting/importing-from-git/) from this github repository.
> This will only work for importing the REST APIs for now, due to a Postman bug I haven't been able to export the GraphQL ones to add it here.

Go through the import process and it should automatically add it to your workspace.

## Option D. Manually download the collection files and import into Postman.
> This will only work for importing the REST APIs for now, due to a Postman bug I haven't been able to export the GraphQL ones to add it here.

The Postman Collection file is a JSON containing all information about each request.

Open Postman and import one of the files [from this folder:](/Postman%20Collections/)
- `Shopify Admin - REST.postman_collection.json`
