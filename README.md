# How to use in your Workspace?

The Postman Collection file is a JSON containing all information about each request.

Open Postman and import the file `Postman Collections`/`Shopify Admin - REST.postman_collection.json`.
You can also import it directly from Github using this repo.

This Collection is using Collection Variables, make sure to fill all the needs before launching requests!

> For some reason, exporting a GraphQL collection in Postman is bugged for me, so I can't export it to add it to this repo, but you can still use it, fork it and view it from the links above (Web View).
